# SECTION 5 — ACCOUNTING BASICS (SIMPLE LANGUAGE)

## What is Debit and Credit?

Think of your business like a story with two sides:

**DEBIT (Left Side):**
- Money coming IN to a cash/bank account
- Goods you buy (assets increasing)
- Expenses you pay

**CREDIT (Right Side):**
- Money going OUT of a cash/bank account
- Sales you make (income)
- Money you owe to others (liability)

### Simple Example:

| Transaction | Debit (Left) | Credit (Right) |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| You sell goods worth Rs.1000 | Cash Rs.1000 | Sales Rs.1000 |
| You buy goods for Rs.500 | Purchases Rs.500 | Cash Rs.500 |
| Customer owes you Rs.1000 | Customer Account Rs.1000 | Sales Rs.1000 |

**Remember:** Every transaction has BOTH a debit and a credit. They must be equal!

## What is Ledger?

A **Ledger** is like a diary for each person or account showing all transactions.

**Example: Customer "ABC Store" Ledger**

| Date | Description | Debit | Credit | Balance |
|------|-------------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1st Jan | Opening Balance | - | - | Rs. 0 |
| 5th Jan | Invoice #101 | Rs. 5,000 | - | Rs. 5,000 |
| 10th Jan | Payment Received | - | Rs. 3,000 | Rs. 2,000 |
| 15th Jan | Invoice #102 | Rs. 3,000 | - | Rs. 5,000 |

This tells you that ABC Store currently owes you **Rs. 5,000**.

## What is Trial Balance?

A **Trial Balance** is a summary of ALL accounts on a specific date.

Think of it like a scale:
- **Left side (Debits)** must equal **Right side (Credits)**
- If they don't match, something is wrong

**Example Trial Balance:**

| Account | Debit | Credit |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Cash | Rs. 50,000 | - |
| Bank | Rs. 200,000 | - |
| Inventory | Rs. 150,000 | - |
| Customers (Receivable) | Rs. 100,000 | - |
| Vendors (Payable) | - | Rs. 75,000 |
| Owner's Capital | - | Rs. 300,000 |
| Sales | - | Rs. 200,000 |
| Purchases | Rs. 60,000 | - |
| Expenses | Rs. 15,000 | - |
| **TOTAL** | **Rs. 575,000** | **Rs. 575,000** |

✅ Both sides equal = Books are balanced!

## What is Profit & Loss?

**Profit & Loss** statement shows if your business made money or lost money.

**Simple Calculation:**
```
Sales (Income)
MINUS
Cost of Goods Sold
MINUS
Expenses
= Profit (or Loss)
```

**Example:**

| Description | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Total Sales | Rs. 500,000 |
| Cost of Goods Sold | (Rs. 350,000) |
| **Gross Profit** | Rs. 150,000 |
| Rent Expense | (Rs. 20,000) |
| Salary Expense | (Rs. 30,000) |
| Electricity | (Rs. 5,000) |
| Transport | (Rs. 10,000) |
| **Net Profit** | **Rs. 85,000** |

You made **Rs. 85,000 profit** this period!

## Why Balancing is Important

1. **Find Errors:** If books don't balance, there's a mistake somewhere
2. **Trust:** Balanced books mean your records are likely correct
3. **Legal:** Tax authorities expect balanced records
4. **Decisions:** You can't make good decisions with wrong numbers
5. **Fraud Detection:** Imbalanced books may indicate fraud

## Common Accounting Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | How to Avoid |
|---------|-------------|
| Entering wrong amount | Always double-check numbers before saving |
| Selecting wrong customer | Read the customer name carefully |
| Forgetting to record payment | Enter receipts immediately when received |
| Entering date wrong | Check date, especially at month start/end |
| Double entry | Check if similar entry exists before adding |
| Wrong payment method | Verify if it's cash, cheque, or bank transfer |
| Missing vendor invoice number | Always get and enter the vendor's bill number |
| Not recording expenses | Enter every expense, even small ones |
